# How to Scrape Tweets with snscrape
This folder contains the jupyter notebooks for my snscrape scraping tutorial published [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-scrape-tweets-from-twitter-59287e20f0f1 "written article").

This folder contains two subfolders based on what method you use with snscrape such as using the CLI commands or the Python wrapper available with snscrape. Each sub-folder contains a Jupyter notebook and Python script that follows the code snippets in my article.

The contents of this folder and its subfolders are shown below.
