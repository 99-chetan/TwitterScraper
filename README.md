# Scraping Tweets from Twitter
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks for my tweet scraping articles.

My beginner tutorial article is available [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-scrape-tweets-from-twitter-59287e20f0f1 "written article").

My advanced tutorial article is available [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-scrape-more-information-from-tweets-on-twitter-44fd540b8a1f "written article").

-WORK IN PROGRESS - My code friendly folder is meant to contain scripts and jupyter notebooks that were meant to be code-friendly for people that don't have a strong understanding of Python but still want to scrape tweets on Twitter.
